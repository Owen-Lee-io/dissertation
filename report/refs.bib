abstract={Recent developments in computer science and digital image processing have enabled the extraction of an individual's heart pulsations from pixel changes in recorded video images of human skin surfaces. This method is termed remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and can be achieved with consumer-level cameras (e.g., a webcam or mobile camera). The goal of the present publication is two-fold. First, we aim to organize future rPPG software developments in a tractable and nontechnical manner, such that the public gains access to a basic open-source rPPG code, comes to understand its utility, and can follow its most recent progressions. The second goal is to investigate rPPG's accuracy in detecting heart rates from the skin surfaces of several body parts after physical exercise and under ambient lighting conditions with a consumer-level camera. We report that rPPG is highly accurate when the camera is aimed at facial skin tissue, but that the heart rate recordings from wrist regions are less reliable, and recordings from the calves are unreliable. Facial rPPG remained accurate despite the high heart rates after exercise. The proposed research procedures and the experimental findings provide guidelines for future studies on rPPG.},

abstract={Plethysmographic signals were measured remotely (> 1m) using ambient light and a simple consumer level digital camera in movie mode. Heart and respiration rates could be quantified up to several harmonics. Although the green channel featuring the strongest plethysmographic signal, corresponding to an absorption peak by (oxy-) hemoglobin, the red and blue channels also contained plethysmographic information. The results show that ambient light photo-plethysmography may be useful for medical purposes such as characterization of vascular skin lesions (e.g., port wine stains) and remote sensing of vital signs (e.g., heart and respiration rates) for triage or sports purposes.},

title={Robust Real-Time Face Detection},
journal={International Journal of Computer Vision},
year={2004},
volume={57},
number={2},
pages={137-154},
abstract={This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "Integral Image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.},
