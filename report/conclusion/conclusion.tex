%Main difference with smart watch is it can measure whenever in the background, so instead should allow easy measurement in the background
%Would require decreasing the energy consumption
% Could use supersampling to try improve performance at a distance
% Much larger scale experimentation => it would not be reasonable to use this software for any serious applications withouth much more large scale testing
% Integrating information from multiple cameras
% Tracking cameras
% Really large scope for home gym environments

% although performance is not perfect, it shows clear improvements over a smartwatch

% effect of illumination was not investigated
