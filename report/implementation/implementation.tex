\subsection{Facial landmarks}
\subsection{Skin detection}
Face detection systems, typically, return a bounding box, within which it is believed
a face is present. However, naturally, the box will also contain pixels from the background of 
the image since faces are not, in general, perfectly rectangular.
These background pixels will not contain any information as to the underlying heart rate of the user.
As a result, considering the entire bounding box will add unecessary noise to the resulting signal.
The ideal algorithm would only consider skin pixels, however, robust, pose-invariant skin detection is an unsolved problem.
On the other hand, considering too few pixels could increase the effect of specular reflection.
