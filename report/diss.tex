\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
\LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the Makefile.  It should
explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
dissertation.


\section*{Work Completed}

All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
document on both CUS and Thor.
