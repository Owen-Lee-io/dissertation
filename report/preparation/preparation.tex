This project, by nature, combines a variety of disciplines and technologies, including, but not limited to, computer vision, sensing and signal processing. 
Before being able to proceed with the project, understanding the required topics in each of these respective fields was critical. Several relevant topics are outlined 
and described in relation to this project.

\section{Heart rate sensing}
Before attempting to develop a system which can estimate the heart rate of a user without physical contact, it is useful to understand how traditional heart rate sensors work.
Although it is clear that a non-contact system is constrained by different requirements, it is common when developing low fidelity sensors to begin by attempting to mimic high fidelity alternatives. \\\\
This project can be viewed as the development of a virtual sensor\footnote{A sensor which does not dervie its results from a direct physical realisation of that sensor} that derives its data from an existing sensor, the camera. It is for this reason, that the planning of the project proceeds by, first, understanding the workings of the two main alternative sensors and then reasoning about how one might derive these results from a camera instead.
\\\\
Electrocardiography and photoplethysmography are the two of the most common techniques for measuring heart rate, each of which proceed by measuring alternate phenomena.

\subsection{Electrocardiography}
% Talk about how it works
% The fact it's a gold standard
% But expensive 
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes that make contact with the skin, measure how the voltage varies with time.
This is critical since at the beat of a heart there is a very specific electrical pattern that occurs. When the cardiac muscles contract, to cause a heart beat, the muscle cells undergo
\textit{depolarization}. This is a change in the overall electric charge of the cell and is measurable by the electodes. \\\\
Through this mechanism, the electrodes can record each beat of the heart and the average number of beats in a given window, is known as the heart rate.

\end{figure}
\noindent
Crucially for this project, the ECG is considered as the highest fidelity means of measuring heart rate. This is because the electrodes can perceive very minor changes in voltage and, thereby, very rarely produce false beats or miss beats of the heart. It is for this reason, that throughout this project it is considered suitable enough to behave as a ground truth for any experiments conducted.
\\\\
It is worth noting that ECG sensors tend to be relatively expensive, and as a result, have fueled the uptake of lower fidelity alternatives.

\subsection{Photoplethysmography}
% Much more common, talk about pulse oximeter
% How the smartwatches have added it 

A common alternative to electrocardiography is photoplethysmography (PPG).
Instead of using an electrical signal to ascertain heart beats, PPG uses an optical sensor to detect changes in the volume of blood passing beneath the skin.
When a heart beat occurs, blood flows outwards from the heart towards the extremities. As a result, there is a perceptible change in the volume of blood passing beneath the skin. Thereby, detecting this change of volume is an alternative proxy to electrical signal for detecting a heart beat.
\\\\
This can be physically realised by a pulse oximeter, which consists of a light that illuminates the skin and a sensor that measures the amount of light absorbed. Typically a pulse oximeter is placed on the end of a finger. An LED emits light on one side of the finger and sensor on the other side measures the amount of light passing through the finger.
Greater volumes of blood will cause more absorption of the light. 
Hence, the amount of light reaching the sensor decreases as the blood reaches the blood vessels between the LED and light sensor.
\begin{figure}[H]

   \caption{An diagram outlining the functioning of a pulse oximeter} 
\end{figure}
\noindent
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example-image-b}
   \caption{An example PPG signal} 
\end{figure}
\noindent
Given this, heart beats can be recognised as peaks in the signal. In this form, pulse oximetry is of high fidelity and is commmonly used in medical scenarios.
However, this requires a relatively stationary finger and, as a result, is not considered practical for sporting activities. In this sense, this form of PPG sensing is not of greater availability than an ECG. As a result, more practical PPG sensors have been developed and incorporated into wearable devices. 

\subsubsection{Wearable PPG sensors}
% Since it's on the wrist it adds a lot of noise, lots of cartilage present which obscures light
% Also sensor is not on the otherside of the skin, it measures reflectance instead
% Energy constraints so low sampling rate
% Movement of wrist
% All of these mean there is a large decrease in fidelity between pulse oximeter and wrist based PPG
