This project, by nature, combines a variety of disciplines and technologies, including, but not limited to, computer vision, sensing and signal processing. 
Before being able to proceed with the project, understanding the required topics in each of these respective fields was critical. Several relevant topics are outlined 
and described in relation to this project.

\section{Heart rate sensing}
Before attempting to develop a system which can estimate the heart rate of a user without physical contact, it is useful to understand how traditional heart rate sensors work.
Although it is clear that a non-contact system is constrained by different requirements, it is common when developing low fidelity sensors to begin by attempting to mimic high fidelity alternatives. \\\\
This project is essentially the development of a virtual sensor\footnote{} that derives its data from an existing sensor, the camera. For this reason, understanding the workings of the two main alternative sensors is critical. By under
