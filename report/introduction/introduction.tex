\paragraph{Overview}
Optical heart rate monitors, the kind of which are standard in modern wearables,
work by measuring the amount of light emitted by the surface of the skin.
Given this signal, a heart rate can be extracted by analysing the predominant frequencies. In principle, 
this notion, can be extended to traditional cameras such as those present in smartphones, which also work by effectively measuring light intensity.
This project is concerned with the implementation of such a system which can infer the heart rate of a user from a video of that user, recorded by a camera 
present in smartphone or similar device.

\paragraph{Motivation}
In general, sensing technology has progressed in recent times from high fidelity and low availability to low fidelity and high availability.
Heart rate sensing used to be the remit of expensive electrocardiogram devices in hospitals, but is now commonplace in relatively low cost wearable devices.
This trend allows increasing number of users to gain access to their own health data relatively easily albeit at the cost of decreased fidelity.
I argue that smartphones are in fact of greater availability than wearables and, thereby, the development of heart rate sensing capabilities for 
smartphones represents further progress in this wider trend. 
In fact, I will later argue that smartphones are of greater fidelity that wearable devices for heart rate sensing, in which case, they represent a much more significant
