\section{Motivation}
Optical heart rate monitors, the kind of which are standard in modern wearables,
work by measuring the amount of light emitted by the surface of the skin.
Given this signal, a heart rate can be extracted by analysing the predominant frequencies, for example, through the use
of a Fourier transform.

\par
This notion, can be extended to traditional cameras such as those present in smartphones.
